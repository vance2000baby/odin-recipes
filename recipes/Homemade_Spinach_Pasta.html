    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A go-to spinach pasta recipe. Spinach adds a beautiful color and flavor to pasta when introduced to the mix. Getting the blend right can be tricky, but this recipe will show you how.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ounces spinach</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine water and ice in a bowl. Preheat a skillet over medium heat; add spinach. Cook, stirring continuously, until spinach turns bright green, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Plunge into ice water bath; remove when spinach is lukewarm. Squeeze out excess moisture with cheesecloth.</li>
        <li>Combine spinach, eggs, olive oil, and salt in a food processor; blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add flour; blend until dough no longer sticks to the blades, adding flour as needed.</li>
        <li>Roll dough into a ball; wrap in plastic wrap. Rest at room temperature for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove plastic wrap from dough. Transfer to a work surface generously dusted with flour; cut dough into 4 pieces with a sharp knife.</li>
        <li>Roll out dough with a rolling pin to 1/4-inch thickness; shape into rectangles.</li>
        <li>Dust pasta maker rollers with flour. Run the dough rectangles through a pasta maker on the widest setting. Repeat rolling dough through rollers, gradually reducing the setting to desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Change the pasta maker's attachment to the preferred noodle shape; cut pasta with the pasta maker.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Lower pasta gently into water; use a spoon to keep noodles from sticking together. Cook until pasta is firm but soft, 3 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the water with tongs; transfer to a bowl.</li>
    </ol>
